# Free Chat
[My Notes](notes.md)

Free Chat is an online discussion board where users can create and view discussions on various topics, from favorite restaraunts to best music. Users can create an account by adding their username on the main page. Users click on a discussion in the list to enter that discussion and can add their comments. Comment amounts are displayed next to each discussion so users can see how active their discussion is. The info tab will describe what the user can do on the main page and how to do them.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever endlessly debated with your friends about different topics, or be discussion important things in a team meeting, only to run out of time and have to pause the discussion? The Free Chat application makes it so a group of people can pull out their phones, clearly see active discussions, and pick up wherre the discussion left off, as well as create many new discussions. As each user makes their discussions, they are automatically added and displayed in realtime to all the other app users. Once someone adds a comment, the total amoutn of that discussion's comments will be displayed on the main page.

### Design

### Diagram

Here is how a user would make a discussion and how making a comment would work with the backend of the app when commenting on a discussion. User makes new discussion, everyone else can see it, another comments in said discussion, that comment can be viewed by others and the number of that discussion's comments goes up.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct html structure for app. Two pages, one main for login and discussion choice/creation, and one for the discussion itself with the comments.
- **CSS** - Styling that looks simple yet good, good use of whitespce and contrast, easily readable layout of titles and interactable elements such as the creat tab and individual discussions.
- **React** - Provides login, discussion display and main page display, creating a new discussion, commenting, display other users comments and the individual comment total for each discussion, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
login
retrieving discussions 
creating discussions
commenting
retrieving total comments for each discussion
Will use a third party news API to allow users to find the latest news topics as a way of finding discussion tpics for new chats
- **DB/Login** - Store users, discussions, and comments/comment totals in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't comment or create discussions unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** -  As each user comments or creates discussions, their discussions are broadcast to all other users on the main page. As they comment, those comments are broadcast to everyone within the discussion while the total amount of that discussion's comments are updated and broadcast on the main page to every user.
