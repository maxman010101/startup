# Free Chat
[My Notes](notes.md)

Free Chat is an online discussion board where users can create and view discussions on various topics, from favorite restaraunts to best music. Users can create an account by adding their username on the main page. Users click on a discussion in the list to enter that discussion and can add their comments. Comment amounts are displayed next to each discussion so users can see how active their discussion is. The info tab will describe what the user can do on the main page and how to do them.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever endlessly debated with your friends about different topics, or be discussion important things in a team meeting, only to run out of time and have to pause the discussion? The Free Chat application makes it so a group of people can pull out their phones, clearly see active discussions, and pick up wherre the discussion left off, as well as create many new discussions. As each user makes their discussions, they are automatically added and displayed in realtime to all the other app users. Once someone adds a comment, the total amoutn of that discussion's comments will be displayed on the main page.
